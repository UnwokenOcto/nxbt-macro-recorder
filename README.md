# NXBT Macro Recorder

NXBT Macro Recorder is a tool that allows you to record macros for [NXBT](https://github.com/Brikwerk/nxbt/).

## Usage

To record a macro and store it in a file, run the following command:

```python
python macro.py <macro_name>
```

The inputs will be recorded until the Screenshot button (15) is pressed.

## TODO

* Implement recording of axis inputs (LB, RB, Left Stick, Right Stick)
